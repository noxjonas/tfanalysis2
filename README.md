Early workings of an application dedicated to the analysis thermal
shift data.

Intention is to use django backend to manage and process data, PostgreSQL
to store it and Angular for the frontend. All three to be built as 
docker container deployable on internal networks.

Eventually... this could become a tool for high-throughput analysis of 
protein targets and bioactive compounds with applications in biotechnology
and medicinal chemistry.
